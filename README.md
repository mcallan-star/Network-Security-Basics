# Network Security Exploration: Ubuntu

Welcome!

This repository documents my journey exploring Ubuntu as part of my graduate studies in network security. It contains assignments, labs, and resources that showcase my hands-on experience with Linux systems, cybersecurity concepts, and practical tools. Everything here runs in a self-contained environment (virtual machines, Docker, and other lab setups), so I can safely simulate attacks, defenses, and monitoring without touching production systems.
